This page defines a few things to contribute the code. It lets the code organized and easy for new contributors. It's not the most rigorous documentation, but it's to not make everything a mess.

You can contribute via **Issues** or **Pull Requests**. If you want to contribute via pull requests, **make sure to suggest the changes to the `develop` branch**.

**Note:** if you don't agree with this, feel free to fork the project and make any changes you want.

# Translation
The localization files are located in [/locales/](./locales/).

To start the translation, choose a locale file that you want to translate — it's recommended that you use the English file as the basis for translating to the desired language — and then make the changes. You can adapt sentences to fit more in your language as long as it doesn't lose it's meaning.

**DON'T use Google Translate all time**. It's ok to use the translator sometimes, but the translation can lose some of the meaning, you must always review it. If you don't know how to translate, I don't recommend you to make any change.

If you see a pull request for a language you understand, if necessary, please make suggestions to improve the translation.

# Code
The code definitions and descriptions must be maintained in English. Bot files are located in [/src/](./src/).

If you want to contribute to the code, always try to maintain a clean code, the OOP structure, and typing. I'm not the best at this either, but you can review my code and that of the contributors to improve quality and readability.

If your changes are *major* — like new commands or systems — make sure to open an **Issue** first to discuss the changes. If there's  explicit approval from the repository maintainers, you or anyone else can proceed with a pull request. This avoids unwanted or unnecessary features and saves coding time.

**Before writing any code, please review the bot code to know some patterns.**
